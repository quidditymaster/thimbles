dependency policy:

1) if the python module is included in the anaconda python distribution we don't treat it as a dependency
2) if the module is not included in anaconda the absence of the package should be handled gracefully.
   i) an import statement inside a try/except block
   ii) call require("package_name") from any module 

#TODO: make a .yaml dependency file and make the dependencies.py check for everything in the dependencies file
#TODO?: make the dependency file tell you if something is core or tangential and what capabilities you will be missing out on if you omit it.
#TODO: generate the dependencies.yaml file automatically via a script.
