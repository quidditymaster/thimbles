Tools for Handling Integrated Modeling of Breathtakingly Large Ensembles of Spectra

# Installation

if you downloaded a tarball you should just need to add the path to the top level thimbles directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable. try importing thimbles and if you get any import errors for packages try pip installing them.

If you got the thimbles files from a git repository then you will be missing certain data files (e.g. standard spectra and model photosphere grids). If you find that you need the data files then copy them over from the tarball.
